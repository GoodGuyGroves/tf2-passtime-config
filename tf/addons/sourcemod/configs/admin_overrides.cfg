"Overrides" {
    // By default, commands are registered with three pieces of information:
    // 1) Command Name       - "csdm_enable"
    // 2) Command Group Name - "CSDM"
    // 3) Command Level      - "generic"

    // You can override the default flags assigned to individual commands or command groups in this way.
    // To override a group, use the "@" character before the name.

    //  "@CSDM"       "b"   - Override the CSDM group to 'b' flag
    //  "csdm_enable" "bgi" - Override the csdm_enable command to 'bgi' flags

    // Note that order is important for overrides. In the example above,
    // "csdm_enable" overwrites any setting that "csdm_enable" previously had.

    // You can make a command public by using an empty flag string.
