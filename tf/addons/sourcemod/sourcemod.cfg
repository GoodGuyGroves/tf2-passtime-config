// 1  - Show admin activity to non-admins anonymously.
// 2  - If 1 is specified, admin names will be shown.
// 4  - Show admin activity to admins anonymously.

// Are sounds enabled for SourceMod menus? Can be configured in addons/sourcemod/configs/core.cfg.

// How much seconds delay between votes that are "public" or can be spammed?
// Whether or not this is obeyed is dependent on the menu/command.

// How SourceMod should check immunity levels when administrators target each other.
// 0 - Ignore immunity levels (except for specific group immunities).
// 1 - Protect from admins of lower access only.
// 2 - Protect from admins of equal to or lower access.
// 3 - Same as 2, except admins with no immunity can affect each other.

// The time allowed between chat messages, including "say" and "say_team" commands.

// Sets how the reserved slots plugin operates.
// 0 - Public slots are used in preference to reserved slots. Reserved slots are freed before public slots.
// 1 - If a reserve access user joins, a regular spectator with the highest latency is kicked first, and if there are no spectators, a player with the highest latency is kicked.
//     The only situation where the reserved slot(s) can become properly occupied is if the server is full with reserve slot access clients.
// 2 - Like 1, but when a certain number of admins have been reached, the reserve slot stops kicking people
//     and anyone can join to fill the server. Can be used to simulate having a large number of reserved slots
//     with sm_reserve_type 0 but with only need to have 1 slot unavailable when there are less admins connected.
// Requires reservedslots.smx
sm_reserve_type                 0

// Sets reserved slot count. Reservation admin flag users can join the server when it is out of public slots.
// Users without the flag will be kicked. (Public slots are defined as maxplayers-reserved_slots)
// Requires reservedslots.smx

sm_hide_slots                   0 // If reserved slots will be hidden (subtracted from max slot count).                              Requires reservedslots.smx
sm_chat_mode                    1 // If non-admins can send messages to admins using say_team @<message>.                            Requires basechat.smx

sm_trigger_show                 0 // If chat triggers are broadcast to the server or just the player who requested the info trigger. Requires basetriggers.smx
sm_vote_progress_hintbox        0 // Display vote progress to clients in the "hint" box (near the bottom of the screen in most games).
sm_vote_progress_chat           0 //                       to clients in the chat area.
sm_vote_progress_console        0 //                       in the server console.
